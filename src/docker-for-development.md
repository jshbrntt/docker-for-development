    - What ISP are you using?
    - What's your internet speed like?

- You and your friend want to work on the project together.
    - He's a good developer but doesn't know how to Linux/Windows he wants to use what he's most familiar and productive with e.g. macOS.

- Enter Docker
    - ./assets/it-works-on-my-machine.jpg
    - We'll ship your file system*
    - Lets you target Kuberenetes as your deployment target.
        - You want Kubernetes because it makes scaling your application and infrastructure easy.

- Okay how to we Dockerize this application

    - Covers production use case, not development.

        - https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/nodejs-docker-webapp/

    - Covers development.
        - https://www.docker.com/blog/keep-nodejs-rockin-in-docker/

- Dockerfile
    - FROM node (nothing else)

Okay this works fine but where is our code?

Bind mount, okay we have our code.

Wait why doesn't our node_modules work?

- C++ addons
https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html

Although our code is JavaScript it like Node.js is dependent on Node modules which depend on C++ addons.

Often because there's something already written in C++ we want to make use of.

Or because the use case is computationally intensive (crypto) and needs to be as fast as possible.

- rm -rf node_modules
npm install

Wait this is really slow why?
- macOS

Okay well lets install it in the parent.

or try symlinking.

- Benefits of installing node_modules as part of the development image.

- We have to do it on the CI anyway so why not store these node_modules in a Docker image and use it as a cache.

- This means if our project has been tested and ran in the CI environment our only bottle neck is downloading the image

(no compilation or module resolution required)

We want to add a database.

- What is a Docker image?
    - It's just a tar archive with some magic around it.

- Dockerfile
    - Multi-stage builds

- Installing node_modules on host filesystem is slow on macOS, fine on Linux, meh on Windows.


# - Best Case Scenario
#
# So maybe you developing your application and hosting it on the same box.
#
# Questionable choice (for reasons I won't go into right now, but cool you do you).
#
# - Power cut at your house your application goes down and you loose market share and revenue because of it.
#
# Okay maybe having it on my home computer was a bad idea.
#
# Lets pack up my computer and send it to the nearest data center.
#
# They'll never have a power cut right?
#
# Nope, they're probably sensible have have things like Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS).
#
# Oh wait OVHcloud burns down, your server with it and any source code you have.
#
# https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-ovh-fire-idUSKBN2B20NU
#
# Okay no worries we've backed up the server.
#
# Great, so now you find a new hosting provider and you redeploy your site.
#
# You repoint your DNS, great only 1 day of downtime.
#
# Maybe you even deploy it to a different server provider as well in advance for backup.
#
# A couple months later someone posts your application to Hacker News, and it gets upvoted to the top for a day.
#
# Suddenly your TODO app is a viral hit and on that same day same day your website is responding slower and slower to new visitors, until it stops responding all together.

# You phone up SuperCheapServers Inc. and request if you can rent some more servers in the rack.
#
# They come back with sorry we don't have any surplus servers at the moment but we can order some in might get here in 2-3 days?
#
# Not good enough, you want to catch the wave of good press coming your way?
#
# So where do you turn to next? The CLOUD!
#
# Now you are only an button press away from getting a new machine but you still have to setup unzip your project and set it up.
#
# Oh whoops turns out you missed the wave and now you're overpaying on servers when your demand doesn't match.
#
# Doing this setup and teardown is a pain lets automate it.
#
# So maybe you're using Ubuntu 20.04 to develop your application and deploying your application on a Ubuntu 20.04 EC2 instance in AWS?
#
# Maybe you're company mandates you use Ubuntu 20.04 everywhere including development environments.

But first.

Let's cover why you might want to use Docker for your development environment.

Recently I went to a conference in Seattle and a I met a bunch of interesting people.

One person I met had developed a "cross platform" 2D game library, with basic examples and everything.

While at the airport I had a spare moment so I thought I'll download it, build it and run one of the examples.

So this is his documentation which I followed.

    <img src="./assets/build-guide.jpg" alt="build-guide" width="100%" />
</section>

---

<!--

Once I had all the dependencies installed.

I ran the build script, and it compiled successfully (ignoring a few compiler warnings).

When it comes to running an example, you'll see it fails with a relatively informative error about failing to create a window.

So this is not a great experience as a developer.

Especially once who has not experience of the project.

I know a bit of C/C++ and maybe a bit of CMake, but do I know enough about GLFW to immediately know how to to fix this issue?

No!

Looking at this you might be thinking.

Well serves you right for using C.

This is why interpretted languages and JIT compilers exist.

So I can write once and run everywhere.

So given most things have some dependency or another on the operating system.

How do we solve this issue in a way where we do not have to worry about the environment we are running in.

# 📝 Less verbose
# --volume `pwd`:/srv/todo

- Only difference between them is `--mount` will throw an error if the host directory does not exist.
- Whereas `--volume` will stub a missing host directory for you.

I was going to go into more detail here about how you can access the Docker VM directly.

Explain a bit about how OverlayFS works, and other parts of how it is implemented on different platforms.

However, I don't think I've got enough time for that.

So I'll wave it away as magic for now.

But here's an article explaining a bit more about how it works.

Turns out sync file systems isn't just about moving and syncing files.

If you want things like hot reload to work you will also need to propagate and communicate file events between systems, so it gets quite complicated.

All your really need to know is bind mounts are great!

But you should pick when to use them wisely because they don't work great on all platforms and can be very slow in certain use cases.

Namely...

- Installation of node_modules
- Working directories for things like databases

# :thinking: How to handle `node_modules`?

* Use 🐧 Linux (VM etc.) for development
    * Not very inclusive 🤨
* Install `node_modules` outside of the bind mount directory
    * ❌ Makes `node_modules` inaccessible from the host
        * ✅ But they are visible through debuggers
    * Parent directory inside the container
        * `yarn install --frozen-lockfile --modules-folder ../node_modules`
        * ❌ Doesn't work if dependencies expecting to be in the project root (hardcoded)
    * Symlink to path outside of project directory
        * `node_modules -> /tmp/node_modules`
        * ⚠️ May still not work in some cases
    * Use a persistent Docker volume
        * If you want to use cached `node_modules` from an existing Docker image
        * ⚠️ Managing the volume becomes complicated

# :books: Docker volumes

* ✅ No speed penalty like _**bind mounts**_
* ✅ Use cases
    * Backing up, restoring, migrating data
    * Intermediate file storage
    * Native file system behaviour
    * High performance I/O
        * e.g. Database directories
* ⚠️ Data not easily accessible from host
    * `docker cp` if necessary
* 📄 [Manage data in Docker](https://docs.docker.com/storage/)

# Create a named volume called 'my_db_data_volume'
# Mount the named volume to the path '/data/db' in the container
--name my_db \ # Assign a name to the container
mongo # Use the latest official MongoDB image

# Show running containers

# :thumbsup: Recommended way

* Use `--network <name>` to create a user defined bridge network.
* User-defined bridges provide automatic DNS resolution between containers.
* User-defined bridges provide better isolation.
* Containers can be attached and detached from user-defined networks on the fly.

# :page_facing_up: RTFM

* Vague... :weary:
    * Which version of Node.js? 
    * Which version of Yarn?
    * Which version of MongoDB?
* Not very future proof :warning:
    * Will these steps still work
    5+ years from now?
* What if port `3001` is taken?
    * How do I change it?
* Cross platform?
    * ...works on my machine :angry:

So let's imagine you start a new project.

You've decided to make a TODO app, because the thousands of existing ones do not fit your specific needs.

In the begunning there's all this possibility space yet to be realized.

You might have a bunch of questions that you answered without even thinking twice about.
